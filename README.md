### Description

Combining these two algorithms, a solution capable of solving the production requirements has been implemented. First of all, isolating the pieces from the rest of the environment using SCNet means eliminating unwanted noise or light changes before detecting the location and orientation of the piece.


### Requirements

Python 3.X version


| Library | Version  |
| :---:   | :-: |
| mmdet | 2.12.0 |
| mmcv-full | 1.3.3 |
| pyrr | 0.10.3 |
| simplejson | 3.17.6 |

```
cd tools
python3 tools/train.py looming.py  
```
